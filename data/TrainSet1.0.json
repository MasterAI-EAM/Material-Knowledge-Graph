In contrast to other nanostructures, one-dimensional nanostructures can provide unique advantages in investigating the size and dimensionality dependence of the materials’ physical properties, such as electrical, thermal, and mechanical performances, and in constructing nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices. Among the one-dimensional nanostructures, one-dimensional perovskite manganite nanostructures have been received much attention due to their unusual electron transport and magnetic properties, which are indispensable for the applications in microelectronic, magnetic, and spintronic devices. In the past two decades, much effort has been made to synthesize and characterize one-dimensional perovskite manganite nanostructures in the forms of nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanobelts. Various physical and chemical deposition techniques and growth mechanisms are explored and developed to control the morphology, identical shape, uniform size, crystalline structure, defects, and homogenous stoichiometry of the one-dimensional perovskite manganite nanostructures. This article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research activities that focus on the rational synthesis, structural characterization, fundamental properties, and unique applications of one-dimensional perovskite manganite nanostructures in nanotechnology.

There is increasing recognition that the separator has a critical role in battery performance. Research is supporting the position that compression exerted by the separator has an important role in premature capacity loss. Some companies have suggested that the separator compression set/creep plays a critical role in the battery failure mechanism in float applications. ALABC studies have shown that designs with higher compression improve the cycle life of batteries. Increasing numbers of manufacturers are designing their separators around the end-application of the battery. The separator in a VRLA battery is not an inactive spacer/barrier, as in a flooded lead/acid cell. Instead, these separators function as a key element, the third electrode. This paper reviews aspects of the microglass separator used in VRLA batteries. Information is provided to make a better separator selection, since a 100% microglass media, or any recombinant battery separator mat (RBSM) for a VRLA battery has a critical role in assuring the performance of the battery. A poor design can thus decrease the expected life of the battery.",

Various modes of boundary heat transfer such as radiation, insulation, and natural and forced convections were also included in the model.

We demonstrate the introduction of thiol groups onto the PDMS surface via base-catalyzed equilibration of MTS ((MeO)3Si(CH2)3SH).

This provided information on the dependence of the Hahn-echo decay on the angle between the direction of the uniaxial stretching force and the axis Ẑ defined direction perpendicular to the magnet pole faces of the NMR-scanner. The anisotropy effect on the Hahn-echo decay is correlated with the extension ratio, and it is more evident in the liquid-like regime of the decay. A weaker segmental anisotropy is detected by 1H solid- and Hahn-echo decays recorded by multi-pulse sequences. A qualitative understanding of the angular dependence is obtained by an analytical theory of the Hahn-echo decay adapted to the case of stretched elastomers and to strongly inhomogeneous magnetic fields. Using angular-dependent 1H residual second van Vleck moments and correlation times reported previously [P.T. Callaghan and E.T.

    "input": "Entanglement in fermionic Fock spaceWe propose a generalization of the usual stochastic local operations and classical communications (SLOCC) and local unitary (LU) classifications of entangled pure state fermionic systems based on the spin group. Our generalization relies on the fact that there is a representation of this group acting on the fermionic Fock space, which, when restricted to fixed particle number subspaces, naturally recovers the usual SLOCC transformations. The new ingredient is the occurrence of Bogoliubov transformations of the whole Fock space, which change the particle number. The classification scheme built on the spin group naturally prohibits entanglement between states containing even and odd numbers of fermions. In our scheme the problem of the classification of entanglement types boils down to the classification of spinors where totally separable states are represented by so-called pure spinors. We construct the basic invariants of the spin group and show how some of the known SLOCC invariants are just their special cases. As an example we present the classification of fermionic systems with a Fock space based on six single particle states; an intriguing duality between two different possibilities for embedding three-qubit systems inside the fermionic ones is revealed. This duality is elucidated via an interesting connection to the configurations of wrapped membranes reinterpreted as qubits. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",

We then extend the classical relation between designs and statistics to an application of the fuzzy spreads in statistics, by considering projective spaces as 2-designs. A fuzzy spread then gives a blueprint of how to make groups for test procedures where certain kinds of objects are mixed together and in each group one kind is over-represented.",

A set of basis functions for this representation at a given wave vector on the x axis are obtained by means of projection operators. The transformation properties of the so-called Lifshitz invariant made up of these functions have been examined.

It was observed that ceramics with the largest ionic radii (La, Pr, Nd) crystallized into the Pmcn space group, while the ceramics with intermediate ionic radii (Sm-Gd) exhibited a different crystal structure belonging to the Ccmm space group. For this last group of ceramics, this result was corroborated by SHG and Raman scattering and ruled out any possibility for the non-centrosymmetric C2221 space group, solving a recent controversy in the literature. Finally, according to SXRD, Tb-Lu containing samples exhibited an average defect fluorite structure (Fm 3 ¯ m space group). Nonetheless, broad scattering at forbidden Bragg reflections indicates the presence of short-range domains with lower symmetry.

The size of organic molecules used in various catalytic transformations is often ca. 0.5-1 nm, whereas nanoparticles in the range 2-4 nm are used in supported heterogeneous catalysts. Proposed quantitative treatment of a heterogeneous catalytic mechanism with two kinetically significant steps assumes that a finite number of molecules per a single metal cluster can be adsorbed. A general equation with polynomial terms in the numerator and the denominator is derived for nonideal (nonuniform) surfaces when all kinetic and adsorption constants depend on the spatial arrangements of reacting molecules. A simplified case of a two-step catalytic cycle is discussed, with the first step being adsorption on nanoclusters and the second one being further transformation of absorbed species. The corresponding kinetic equations are derived and numerically analyzed for the case of ideal (uniform) surfaces as well as the presence of induced nonuniformity, when contrary to the ideal case there are lateral interactions between adsorbed species. The form of kinetic equations allows not only saturation, typical for Eley-Rideal kinetics, but also positive cooperativity, i.e., S-shaped behavior of the reaction rate as a function of substrate concentration.

By the replacement of conventional CdS buffer layers with this double buffer layer, the open-circuit voltage (V-oc) deficit of the devices could be significantly reduced, and V-oc increased by approximately 15 mV. In addition, the fill factor and short-circuit current were also improved, increasing the device efficiency by approximately 0.5 absolute percent compared with devices with CdS buffers. The Cd-free double buffer layer improved the device efficiency regardless of the bandgap of the CIGSSe absorber. The minority carrier lifetime (tau) measured via time-resolved photoluminescence became longer, indicating that carrier recombination is mitigated using the double buffer layer.

At open circuit, efficient external luminescence is an indicator of low internal optical losses.

These coatings have a low sensitivity to the angle of incidence and require minimal amounts of absorbing material that can be as thin as 5-20 nm for visible light.

We achieve this by using a validated device model to fit the simulations to the experimental data of efficient vacuum-deposited p-i-n and n-i-p CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells, including the light intensity dependence of the open circuit voltage and fill factor.

The sign of the traps (when filled) is of little importance in efficient solar cells with compact morphologies (fused GBs, low trap density). On the other hand, solar cells with noncompact morphologies (open GBs, high trap density) are sensitive to the sign of the traps and hence to the cell preparation methods. Even in the presence of traps at GBs, trap-assisted recombination at interfaces (between the transport layers and the perovskite) is the dominant loss mechanism.

The materials possess low surface areas (19-217 m(2) g(-1)) and a relatively high electrode packing density (0.75 g cm(-3) vs similar to 1 g cm(-3) for graphite). Tested against Na, BPPG delivers a gravimetric (and volumetric) capacity of 355 mAh g(-1) (by active material similar to 700 mAh cm(-3), by electrode volume similar to 270 mAh cm(-3)) after 10 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). A nearly flat similar to 200 mAh g(-1) plateau that is below 0.1 V and a minimal charge/discharge voltage hysteresis make BPPG a direct electrochemical analogue to graphite but with Na. A charge capacity of 221 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) degraded by 7% after 600 cycles, while a capacity of 336 mAh g(-1) 100 mAg(-1) is degraded by 11% after 300 cycles, in both cases with similar to 100% cycling Coulombic efficiency. For LIB applications BPPG offers a gravimetric (volumetric) capacity of 1090 mAh g(-1) (by material similar to 2200 mAh cm(-3), by electrode similar to 900 mAh cm(-3)) at 50 mA g(-1). The reason that BPPG works so well for both NIBs and LIBs is that it uniquely contains three essential features: (a) dilated intergraphene spacing for Na intercalation at low voltages; (b) highly accessible near-surface nanopores for Li metal filling at low voltages; and (c) substantial defect content in the graphene planes for U adsorption at higher voltages. The <0.1 V charge storage mechanism is fundamentally different for Na versus for Li. A combination of XRD and XPS demonstrates highly reversible Na intercalation rather than metal underpotential deposition.

However, carbon, used ubiquitously as the basis of the cathode, decomposes during Li2O2 oxidation on charge and actively promotes electrolyte decomposition on cycling. Replacing carbon with a nanoporous gold cathode, when in contact with a dimethyl sulphoxide-based electrolyte, does seem to demonstrate better stability. However, nanoporous gold is not a suitable cathode; its high mass destroys the key advantage of Li-O-2 over Li ion (specific energy), it is too expensive and too difficult to fabricate. Identifying a suitable cathode material for the Li-O-2 cell is one of the greatest challenges at present.

Compared with the pristine deposited Zn electrode, the as-fabricated Zn/CNT anode affords lower Zn nucleation overpotential and more homogeneously distributed electric field, thus being more favorable for highly reversible Zn plating/stripping with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency rather than the formation of Zn dendrites or other byproducts.

Such distinct performance overmatches most of recently reported Zn-based anodes.

Using time-resolved terahertz photoconductivity measurements, we show that, for ZnO and SnO2 nanoporous films, electron injection from the sensitizer has substantial slow components lasting over tens to hundreds of picoseconds, while for TiO2, the process is predominantly concluded within a few picoseconds. these results correlate well with the overall electron injection efficiencies we determine from photovoltaic cells fabricated from identical nanoporous films, suggesting that such slow components limit the overall photocurrent generated by the solar cell. We conclude that these injection dynamics are not substantially influenced by bulk energy level offsets but rather by the local environment of the dye-nanoparticle interface that Is governed by dye binding modes and densities of states available for injection, both of which may vary from site to site.

This study provides a rationale to explain and further improve the performance of recently demonstrated high-open-circuit-voltage organic solar cells.",

Here resonant X-ray scattering and microscopy are combined to quantitatively measure the nanoscale domain size, distribution and composition in high efficiency solar cells based on PTB7 and PC71BM. The results show that the solvent additive diiodooctane dramatically shrinks the domain size of pure fullerene agglomerates that are embedded in a polymer-rich 70/30 wt.% molecularly mixed matrix, while preserving the domain composition relative to additive-free devices. The fundamental miscibility between the species measured to be equal to the device's matrix composition is likely the dominant factor behind the overall morphology with the additive affecting the dispersion of excess fullerene. As even the molecular ordering measured by X-ray diffraction is unchanged between the two processing routes the change in the distribution of domain size and therefore increased domain interface is primarily responsible for the dramatic increase in device performance. While fullerene exciton harvesting is clearly one significant cause of the increase owing to smaller domains, a measured increase in harvesting from the polymer species indicates that the molecular mixing is not the reason for the high efficiency in this system. Rather, excitations in the polymer likely require proximity to a pure fullerene phase for efficient charge separation and transport. Furthermore, in contrast to previous measurements on a PTB7-based system, a hierarchical morphology was not observed, indicating that it is not necessary for high performance.",

This paper reviews the tremendous efforts that are made to find a remedy for this problem, mostly through physical or chemical confinement of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Intrinsically, this confinement has a relatively limited effect on improving the battery performance because in most cases, the LiPSs are \"passively\" blocked and cannot be reused. Thus, this strategy becomes less effective with a high sulfur loading and ultralong cycling. A more positive method that not only traps but also increases the subsequent conversion of LiPSs back to lithium sulfides is urgently needed to fundamentally solve the shuttle effect.

This observation is confirmed by ex-situ transmission electron microscopy study and first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that this capacity fading mechanism can be overcome by introducing amphiphilic polymers to modify the carbon surface, rendering strong interactions between the nonpolar carbon and the polar LixS clusters.

In the second part of this review, we focus on the future developments in the field of c-Si solar cells based on carrier-selective passivation layers. Whereas the dielectric layers are insulating and are hence applied only for passivating the non contacted areas of the silicon surface, the carrier-selective passivation layers are intended to provide an effective passivation of non-contacted as well as contacted areas of a c-Si solar cell, thereby increasing the efficiency potential of c-Si solar cells significantly. Due to the fact that the carrier-selective layers are implemented in a contact, besides the good passivation properties for minorities, these layers must also provide a good majority-carrier transport, i.e. they have to provide a low contact resistance. Both properties, i.e. suppression of minority carrier recombination as well as good majority-carrier transport, define the selectivity of the carrier-selective contact, which is an important figure of merit for the assessment and comparison of different types of carrier selective contacts. One very promising type of carrier-selective passivation layer is based on heavily doped polycrystalline silicon layers deposited on a thin silicon oxide layer, the latter providing the excellent passivation while enabling efficient majority-carrier transport via pin-holes and/or tunneling. Moreover, we discuss metal oxides and conductive polymers, which have only recently been applied to c-Si photovoltaics, but seem to have a promising potential as low-cost selective contact materials.

The V-OC-to-bandgap ratio is the highest reported for wide-bandgap organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells and the V-OC also exceeds 90% of the theoretical maximum, defined by the Shockley-Queisser limit. This advance is based on creating a hybrid 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure. By spin coating n-butylammonium bromide on the double-cation perovskite absorber layer, a thin 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite layer of intermediate phases is formed, which mitigates nonradiative recombination in the perovskite absorber layer. As a result, V-OC is enhanced by 80 mV.",

The solar cell performance is determined by its parameters, viz., short circuit current density (J(sc)), open circuit voltage (V-oc), fill factor (FF) and efficiency (eta). Solar cells based on semiconductor materials such as Ge, Si, GaAs, InP, CdTe and CdS are considered here. Reverse saturation current density (J(o)) is an important diode parameter which controls the change in performance parameters with temperature. In this work, reverse saturation current density (J(o)=C.T-3.exp (-qE(g)/kT)) is determined for three cases. Cases (I) and (II) correspond to C=17.90 and 50 mA cm(-2) K-3 respectively, whereas, case (III) corresponds to C.T-3=A=1.5 x 10(8) mA cm(-2). The maximum achievable V-oc, J(sc), FF and eta of solar cells are calculated for AM1.5G and AM0 spectra and are compared with theoretical and experimental results in the literature. Highest V-oc, FF and eta are achieved for case (III). The performance of cells for case (III) gives the best agreement between the calculated and available theoretical and experimental data for solar cells based on the materials, Si, Ge, GaAs whereas, for InP, CdTe and CdS, case (I) seems to be more appropriate at 298 K. Moreover, as temperature changes, cases (I) and (II) are more suitable to describe the performance of solar cells. The rate of change of performance parameters with temperature, viz., dJ(sc)/dT, dV(oc)/dT, dFF/dT and d eta/dT are calculated and compared with the available data in the literature. In addition to theoretical results, the experimentally determined performance parameters of silicon solar cells and their rate of change with temperature are also presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, a well-known paradox is that conventional composites with high thermal conductivity usually suffer from the high dielectric constant and high dielectric loss, while on the other hand, composite materials with excellent dielectric properties usually possess low thermal conductivity. In this work, an ideal dielectric thermally conductive epoxy nanocomposite is successfully fabricated using polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) functionalized boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as fillers. The nanocomposites with 30 wt% fraction of POSS modified BNNTs exhibit much lower dielectric constant, dielectric loss tangent, and coefficient of thermal expansion in comparison with the pure epoxy resin. As an example, below 100 Hz, the dielectric loss of the nanocomposites with 20 and 30 wt% BNNTs is reduced by one order of magnitude in comparison with the pure epoxy resin. Moreover, the nanocomposites show a dramatic thermal conductivity enhancement of 1360% in comparison with the pristine epoxy resin at a BNNT loading fraction of 30 wt%. The merits of the designed composites are suggested to originate from the excellent intrinsic properties of embedded BNNTs, effective surface modification by POSS molecules, and carefully developed composite preparation methods.",

Electronic and optical properties of these materials have been commonly controlled by varying the composition (e.g., the halide component) and/or crystal structure. Use of nanostructured forms of perovskites can provide additional means for tailoring their functionalities via effects of quantum confinement and wave function engineering. Furthermore, it may enable applications that explicitly rely on the quantum nature of electronic excitations. Here, we demonstrate that CsPbX3 quantum dots (X = I, Br) can serve as room-temperature sources of quantum light, as indicated by strong photon antibunching detected in single-dot photoluminescence measurements. We explain this observation by the presence of fast nonradiative Auger recombination, which renders multiexciton states virtually nonemissive and limits the fraction of photon coincidence events to similar to 6% on average. We analyze limitations of these quantum dots associated with irreversible photodegradation and fluctuations (\"blinking\") of the photoluminescence intensity. On the basis of emission intensity-lifetime correlations, we assign the \"blinking\" behavior to random charging/discharging of the quantum dot driven by photoassisted ionization. This study suggests that perovskite quantum dots hold significant promise for applications such as quantum emitters; however, to realize this goal, one must resolve the problems of photochemical stability and photocharging. These problems are largely similar to those of more traditional quantum dots and, hopefully, can be successfully resolved using advanced methodologies developed over the years in the field of colloidal nanostructures.",

    "input": "For retired automotive lithium-ion batteries, state of health (SoH) is currently utilised to grade them for a second-life application. However, researchers previously challenged this and expressed that, in addition to SoH, the actual degradation mechanism, also known as degradation mode (DM), should be considered for grading, for efficient second-life operation. To date, there is little evidence to support this. A validated DM detection technique for cell/module grading does not exist. A modified DM detection technique by tracking and indexing the incremental capacity (IC) curves was previously proposed by the authors; nevertheless, it was difficult to validate. Researchers previously proposed DM identification using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Differential Voltage (DV) analysis. With a direct comparison of the techniques made exploiting IC, DV, and EIS, a correlation can be made, which is presented in this article. The correlation suggests that cells identified as having the same (or different) DM by the proposed technique also identified as having the same (or different) DM growth by EIS technique proposed by other researchers. Likewise, DV analysis suggests that the DV peak's standard deviation of similar DM cells is smaller than that of the different DM cells.",

However, the battery shows a short cycle life (7.1% remaining capacity after 1000 cycles) due to the dissolution of VHCF. To elongate the cycle life of the battery, a high-concentration hybrid electrolyte is used to reduce the activity of water molecules.

Pseudocapacitive materials offer the promise to combine these properties by storing charge through surface-controlled, battery-like redox reactions but at high rates approaching those of electrochemical double-layer capacitors.

    "input": "In vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications, dual active bridge (D) converters are commonly used as the power interface because they offer high efficiency, galvanic isolation, and bidirectional power flow. For the D control strategy, phase-shift control is the mainstream, especially the single-phase-shift (SPS) method because of its ease of implementation. However, due to the phase shift, a D converter operated under this control method has relatively high backflow power, resulting in poor efficiency. The SPS control method has the drawback of high backflow power, especially at light loads. Thus, this paper proposes a new dual-mode control scheme to improve the light load efficiency of D converters by taking advantage of the pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategy in combination with the conventional SPS strategy for D converters based on load conditions. In other words, when the D converter operates under light load conditions, the PWM control strategy is used to avoid considerable backflow power. A prototype D converter with a power rating of 1 kW under a switching frequency of 100 kHz interfacing a DC bus (400 V) and a battery pack (50 V) is designed and implemented to verify the feasibility of this control strategy. A detailed analysis of the working principle and design parameters of the proposed converter is provided in this paper. Experimental results show that the highest efficiency of the proposed converter at light loads (10-200 W) was 96.2% for the forward power conversion and 97.3% for the backward power conversion.",

The elastomer can autonomously recover by 50% even at a subzero temperature of -30 degrees C within 24 h. The elastomer-based TENG, as a self-driven sensor for detecting human behavior, is demonstrated to exhibit stable outputs and self-healing in the temperature range of -30 to 60 degrees C, and so is expected to promote the development of self-powered electronics for next-generation human-machine communications.",

The vertical alignments are preserved and spontaneously form porous microstructures by Pulse Freezing the GO solutions inside the channel. This combined process results in the increase of levels of microstructure porosity and vertical alignment of GO films. The alignment and porous microstructures increase both electron and ion transfer capabilities across the prepared film. The half-cell performance of aligned GO films shows a specific capacity of 440 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) after 150 cycles. This is a 190% specific capacity increase compared to the performance of a half-cell prepared with GO without the high level of vertical alignment and microporosity.

The phase stability and separation process of Al-Sn film, fabricated by magnetron co-sputtering method, was investigated by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and explained by Miedema theoretical model. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the as-deposited Al-Sn film will decompose spontaneously into Al-riched areas and Sn-riched areas because of the positive mixing enthalpy. The crystallization process takes place when the Al content in the Al-riched area or Sn content in the Sn-riched area increases. Experimental results show that Al-Sn thin film is composed of an amorphous matrix and well-dispersed composite nanoparticles. Every particle contains an Al-riched area and a Sn-riched area. The Sn-riched area crystallizes and swallows up the Al-riched area gradually during heating through uphill diffusion of the Sn atoms. Based on the theoretical analysis and experimental results, an empirical model to explain the phase evolution process in the Al-Sn film was proposed.",

However, the R-s value of betavoltaic batteries tends to be anomaly high when it is extracted from the IV characteristic curve. To explore the reasons for this phenomenon, different injection conditions and their impacts on R-s of betavoltaic and photovoltaic cells were compared and analyzed, since photovoltaic cells have been studied in-depth in respect of R-s and have similar principles to betavoltaic batteries. The results show that R-s will be significantly affected by the injection conditions, and the high resistance of the depletion region under low-level radiation injection of betavoltaic batteries is the main reason for their high R-s . The effect of high R-s on betavoltaic battery performance was further explored, and the results show that the IV characteristic curve will be distorted obviously when R-s is close to or higher than the shunt resistance. This thus leads to a significant decrease in the battery's fill factor and energy conversion efficiency. The effect of the input power on R-s should be considered in the future analysis of betavoltaic batteries.

The combination of solvent and polymer enables quasi-liquid fast ion transport in the GPEs. However, different ion transport capacity between solvent and polymer will cause local nonuniform Li+ distribution, leading to severe dendrite growth. In addition, the poor thermal stability of the solvent also limits the operating-temperature window of the electrolytes. Optimizing the ion transport environment and enhancing the thermal stability are two major challenges that hinder the application of GPEs. Here, a strategy by introducing ion-conducting arrays (ICA) is created by vertical-aligned montmorillonite into GPE. Rapid ion transport on the ICA was demonstrated by Li-6 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, combined with computer simulations to visualize the transport process. Compared with conventional randomly dispersed fillers, ICA provides continuous interfaces to regulate the ion transport environment and enhances the tolerance of GPEs to extreme temperatures. Therefore, GPE/ICA exhibits high room-temperature ionic conductivity (1.08 mS cm(-1)) and long-term stable Li deposition/stripping cycles (> 1000 h). As a final proof, Li parallel to GPE/ICA parallel to LiFePO4 cells exhibit excellent cycle performance at wide temperature range (from 0 to 60 degrees C), which shows a promising path toward all-weather practical solid-state batteries.",

However, the typical sintering temperature for the widely used electron transport material, that is, TiO2, is more than 400 degrees C, elevating the cost and hindering the application. Due to high electron mobility and low fabrication temperature, ZnO becomes a desirable alternative for TiO2, as the ETL in CsPbIBr2 PSCs, albeit with low open-circuit voltage (V-oc). Herein, this work introduces a trace of NH4Cl to the sol-gel-derived ZnO precursor to decrease the work function of the ZnO film, tune the surface morphology of the perovskite film, and thus suppress the density of trap states in the CsPbIBr2 films. Consequently, full-coverage and pure-phase CsPbIBr2 films consisting of micron-size and high-crystallinity grains are obtained. More importantly, for the optimal NH4Cl-modified ZnO, a shining improvement in V-oc from 1.08 to 1.27V boosts the champion CsPbIBr2 PSCs to obtain a power conversion efficiency of 10.16%, which is the highest value reported among pure-CsPbIBr2 PSCs under a low fabrication temperature of 160 degrees C.

Here, a judiciously engineered passivator, 4-tert-butyl-benzylammonium iodide (tBBAI), is introduced, whose bulky tert-butyl groups prevent the unwanted aggregation by steric repulsion. It is found that simple surface treatment with tBBAI significantly accelerates the charge extraction from the perovskite into the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporter, while retarding the nonradiative charge carrier recombination. This boosts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSC from approximate to 20% to 23.5% reducing the hysteresis to barely detectable levels. Importantly, the tBBAI treatment raises the fill factor from 0.75 to the very high value of 0.82, which concurs with a decrease in the ideality factor from 1.72 to 1.34, confirming the suppression of radiation-less carrier recombination. The tert-butyl group also provides a hydrophobic umbrella protecting the perovskite film from attack by ambient moisture.

However, the high ratio of surface area to volume makes CQD films prone to high trap state densities if surfaces are imperfectly passivated, promoting recombination of charge carriers that is detrimental to device performance(7). Recent advances have replaced the long insulating ligands that enable colloidal stability following synthesis with shorter organic linkers or halide anions(8-12), leading to improved passivation and higher packing densities. Although this substitution has been performed using solid-state ligand exchange, a solution-based approach is preferable because it enables increased control over the balance of charges on the surface of the quantum dot, which is essential for eliminating midgap trap states(13,14). Furthermore, the solution-based approach leverages recent progress in metal: chalcogen chemistry in the liquid phase(15-19). Here, we quantify the density of midgap trap states(20-22) in CQD solids and show that the performance of CQD-based photovoltaics is now limited by electron-hole recombination due to these states. Next, using density functional theory and optoelectronic device modelling, we show that to improve this performance it is essential to bind a suitable ligand to each potential trap site on the surface of the quantum dot. We then develop a robust hybrid passivation scheme that involves introducing halide anions during the end stages of the synthesis process, which can passivate trap sites that are inaccessible to much larger organic ligands. An organic crosslinking strategy is then used to form the film. Finally, we use our hybrid passivated CQD solid to fabricate a solar cell with a certified efficiency of 7.0%, which is a record for a CQD photovoltaic device.",

Bimolecular and Auger recombination rate constants are found to be sensitive to changes in electronic confinement, which alters the density of states for electronic transitions. We demonstrate that effective charge-carrier mobilities remain remarkably high (near 10 cm(2)V-(1)s(-1)) for intermediate PEA content and are enhanced for preferential orientation of the conducting lead iodide layers along the probing electric field.

The resulting, graphene/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry, nitrogen adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The transient photocurrent response was measured for several on-off cycles of intermittent irradiation. The effect of graphene content on the rate of visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production was studied for a series of graphene-graphitic carbon nitride composite samples containing Pt as a cocatalyst in methanol aqueous solutions. This study shows that graphene sheets act as electronic conductive channels to efficiently separate the photogenerated charge carriers and, consequently, to enhance the visible-light photocatalytic H-2-production activity of g-C3N4. The optimal graphene content was determined to be similar to 1.0 wt %, and the corresponding H-2-production rate was 451 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which exceeded that of pure g-C3N4 by more than 3.07 times. The proposed mechanism for the enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 modified by a 5 mall amount of graphene was further confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy and transient photocurrent response. The metal-free graphene/g-C3N4 composites showed high visible-light photocatalytic activity, which makes them promising nanomaterials for further applications in water treatment and dye-sensitized solar cells.",

In this paper, an efficient CsPbBrI2 perovskite solar cell (PSC) with a dimensionally graded heterojunction is reported, in which the CsPbBrI2 material is distributed within bulk-nanosheet-quantum dots or 3D-2D-0D dimension-profiled interface structure so that the energy alignment is optimized in between the valence and conduction bands of both CsPbBrI2 and the HEL layers. Specifically, the valence-/conduction-band edge is leveraged to bend with synergistic advantages: the graded combination enhances the hole extraction and conduction efficiency with effectively decreased recombination loss during the hole-transfer process, leading to an enhanced built-in electric field, hence a high V-OC of as much as 1.19 V. The profiled structure induces continuously upshifted energy levels, resulting in a higher J(SC) of as much as 12.93 mA cm(-2) and fill factor as high as 80.5%, and therefore record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.39%.

Moreover, due to the suppressed nonradiative recombination, the unencapsulated photovoltaic devices can work well as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), exhibiting an external quantum efficiency of 3.85% and a long operational lifetime of approximate to 96 h at a high current density of 200 mA cm(-2) in air.",

However, the poor reversibility and infinite volume change of Li metal hinder the realistic implementation of Li metal in battery community. Herein, a commercially viable hybrid Li-ion/metal battery is realized by a coordinated strategy of symbiotic anode and prelithiated cathode. To be specific, a scalable template-removal method is developed to fabricate the porous graphite layer (PGL), which acts as a symbiotic host for Li ion intercalation and subsequent Li metal deposition due to the enhanced lithiophilicity and sufficient ion-conducting pathways. A continuous dissolution-deintercalation mechanism during delithiation process further ensures the elimination of dead Li. As a result, when the excess plating Li reaches 30%, the PGL could deliver an ultrahigh average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% for 180 cycles with a capacity of 2.48 mAh cm(-2) in traditional carbonate electrolyte.

However, their commercial application is challenging due to severe capacity degradation and voltage fading caused by irreversible oxygen evolution and phase transition upon repeated cycling. This work proposes an effective strategy to improve the long-term electrochemical performances of Li1.2Mn0.56Ni0.17Co0.07O2 (LMNCO) by constructing multifunctional nanolayers composed of element-doping, layered-spinel heterostructural connection, and fast ion conductor shell via a facile method. The Li0.09B0.97PO4 (LBPO) coating shell acts as a fast ion carrier and physical screen to promote Li+ diffusion and isolate side reactions at the cathode-electrolyte interface; moreover, two-phase transitional region provides three-dimensional channel to facilitate Li+ transport and inhibit phase transition. Besides, B3+ and PO43--doping collaborates with oxygen vacancies to stabilize lattice oxygen and restrain oxygen evolution from the bulk active cathode. The optimized LMNCO@LBPO material exhibits a superior capacity retention of 78.6%, higher than that of the pristine sample (49.3%), with the mitigated voltage fading of 0.73 mV per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C.

However, the high ratio of surface area to volume makes CQD films prone to high trap state densities if surfaces are imperfectly passivated, promoting recombination of charge carriers that is detrimental to device performance(7). Recent advances have replaced the long insulating ligands that enable colloidal stability following synthesis with shorter organic linkers or halide anions(8-12), leading to improved passivation and higher packing densities. Although this substitution has been performed using solid-state ligand exchange, a solution-based approach is preferable because it enables increased control over the balance of charges on the surface of the quantum dot, which is essential for eliminating midgap trap states(13,14). Furthermore, the solution-based approach leverages recent progress in metal: chalcogen chemistry in the liquid phase(15-19). Here, we quantify the density of midgap trap states(20-22) in CQD solids and show that the performance of CQD-based photovoltaics is now limited by electron-hole recombination due to these states. Next, using density functional theory and optoelectronic device modelling, we show that to improve this performance it is essential to bind a suitable ligand to each potential trap site on the surface of the quantum dot. We then develop a robust hybrid passivation scheme that involves introducing halide anions during the end stages of the synthesis process, which can passivate trap sites that are inaccessible to much larger organic ligands. An organic crosslinking strategy is then used to form the film. Finally, we use our hybrid passivated CQD solid to fabricate a solar cell with a certified efficiency of 7.0%, which is a record for a CQD photovoltaic device.",

However, nonradiative charge carrier recombination, at grain boundaries limits open circuit voltages and consequent performance improvements of perovskite solar cells. Here we address such recombination pathways and demonstrate a passivation effect through guanidinium-based additives to achieve extraordinarily enhanced carrier lifetimes and higher obtainable open circuit voltages. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements yield carrier lifetimes in guanidinium-pased films an order of magnitude greater than pure-methylammonitin counterparts, giving rise to higher device open circuit voltages and power conversion efficiencies exceeding 17%. A reduction in defect activation energy of over 30% calculated via admittance spectroscopy and confocal fluorescence intensity mapping indicates successful passivation of recombination/trap centers at grain boundaries. We speculate that guanidinium ions serve to suppress formation of iodide vacancies and passivate under-coordinated iodine species at grain boundaries and within the bulk through their hydrogen bonding capability.

Quasi two-dimensional (2D) perovskites that incorporate hydrophobic organic interlayers offer improved resistance to degradation by moisture, currently still at the cost of overall cell efficiency. To elucidate the factors affecting the optoelectronic properties of these materials, we have investigated the charge transport properties and crystallographic orientation of mixed methylammonium (MA)-phenylethylammonium (PEA) lead iodide thin films as a function of the MA-to-PEA ratio and, thus, the thickness of the \"encapsulated\" MA lead halide layers. We find that monomolecular charge-carrier recombination rates first decrease with increasing PEA fraction, most likely as a result of trap passivation, but then increase significantly as excitonic effects begin to dominate for thin confined layers. Bimolecular and Auger recombination rate constants are found to be sensitive to changes in electronic confinement, which alters the density of states for electronic transitions. We demonstrate that effective charge-carrier mobilities remain remarkably high (near 10 cm(2)V-(1)s(-1)) for intermediate PEA content and are enhanced for preferential orientation of the conducting lead iodide layers along the probing electric field.

However, such dopant-free SM-HTMs are highly elusive, limiting the current record efficiencies of inverted PVSCs to around 19%.

However, a significant limitation of these devices still stems from parasitic light absorption in the amorphous silicon layers. This can be mitigated by replacing the traditional (p) and (n) doped amorphous silicon selective layers by other materials. While promising results have been achieved using molybdenum oxide (MoOx) as a front-side hole-selective layer, charge transport mechanisms in that contact stack have remained elusive and device efficiencies below predictions.

However, sluggish kinetics and aggravated dendrites present two major challenges for anodes to achieve the goal at low-T. Herein, we propose an interlayer confined strategy for tailoring nitrogen terminals on Ti3C2 MXene (Ti3C2-N-funct) to address these issues. The introduction of nitrogen terminals endows Ti3C2-N-funct with large interlayer space and charge redistribution, improved conductivity and sufficient adsorption sites for Na+, which improves the possibility of Ti3C2 for accommodating more Na atoms, further enhancing the Na+ storage capability of Ti3C2. As revealed, Ti3C2-N-funct not only possesses a lower Na-ion diffusion energy barrier and charge transfer activation energy, but also exhibits Na+-solvent co-intercalation behavior to circumvent a high de-solvation energy barrier at low-T. Besides, the solid electrolyte interface dominated by inorganic compounds is more beneficial for the Na+ transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Compared with of the unmodified sample, Ti3C2-N-funct exhibits a twofold capacity (201 mAh g(-1)), fast-charging ability (18 min at 80% capacity retention), and great superiority in cycle life (80.9%@5000 cycles) at - 25 degrees C.

This enables AR-ZMB full cells constructed with nanoporous ZnxCuy/Zn anode and KzMnO2 cathode to achieve specific energy of as high as similar to 430 Wh kg(-1) with similar to 99.8% Coulombic efficiency, and retain similar to 86% after long-term cycles for > 700 h.",

Owing to the substitution of Ni-B dual-doping for Mn, the MnO6 octahedron in the LiMn2O4 generates a contraction that leads to the increased average Mn oxidation state and the suppressed Jahn-Teller effect. Simultaneously, the expansive LiO4 tetrahedron is conducive to boosting the fast Li+ diffusion. Moreover, the growth of {110} crystal planes in the LiMn1.90-xNi0.10BxO4 (x = 0.02-0.15) is also restrained by the Ni-B co-doping, hence alleviating the Mn dissolution.

The assembled quasi-solid-state cell with the as-prepared UTSPL-35SBACE membrane displays superior cycling performance with a discharge capacity of 105 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 degrees C rate after 100 cycles and excellent rate performance (82 mAh g(-1) at 5 degrees C rate) at room temperature with the potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate (KMHCF)@CNTs/CNFs cathode, where KMHCF refers to potassium manganese hexacyanoferrate.",

Hydrogen-treated rutile TiO2 (H:TiO2) nanowires were prepared by annealing the pristine TiO2 nanowires in hydrogen atmosphere at various temperatures in a range of 200-550 degrees C. In comparison to pristine TiO2 nanowires, H:TiO2 samples show substantially enhanced photocurrent in the entire potential window. More importantly, H:TiO2 samples have exceptionally low photocurrent saturation potentials of -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl (0.4 V vs RHE), indicating very efficient charge separation and transportation. The optimized H:TiO2 nanowire sample yields a photocurrent density of similar to 1.97 mA/cm(2) at -0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, in 1 M NaOH solution under the illumination of simulated solar light (100 mW/cm(2) from 150 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter). This photocurrent density corresponds to a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of similar to 1.63%. After eliminating the discrepancy between the irradiance of the xenon lamp and solar light, by integrating the incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the H:TiO2 nanowire sample with a standard AM 1.5G solar spectrum, the STH efficiency is calculated to be similar to 1.1%, which is the best value for a TiO2 photoanode. IPCE analyses confirm the photocurrent enhancement is mainly due to the improved photoactivity of TiO2 in the UV region. Hydrogen treatment increases the donor density of TiO2 nanowires by 3 orders of magnitudes, via creating a high density of oxygen vacancies that serve as electron donors. Similar enhancements in photocurrent were also observed in anatase H:TiO2 nanotubes.

By investigating the effect of different addition ratios of graphene on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2-GR systematically, we find that the higher weight ratio in TiO2-GR will decrease the photocatalytic activity. Analogous phenomenon is also observed for the liquid-phase degradation of dyes over TiO2-GR. In addition, the key features for TiO2-GR including enhancement of adsorptivity of pollutants, light absorption intensity, electron-hole pairs lifetime, and extended light absorption range have also been found in the composite of TiO2 and carbon nanotubes (TiO2-CNT). These strongly manifest that TiO2-GR is in essence the same as other TiO2-carbon (carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, and activated carbon) composite materials on enhancement of photocatalytic activity of TiO2, although graphene by itself has unique structural and electronic properties. Notably, this key fundamental question remains completely unaddressed in a recent report (ACS Nano 2010, 4, 380) regarding liquid-phase degradation of dyes over the TiO2-GR photocatalyst.

The present work developed a facile in situ method to construct g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free isotype heterojunction with molecular composite precursors with the aim to greatly promote the charge separation. Considering the fact that g-C3N4 samples prepared from urea and thiourea separately have different band structure, the molecular composite precursors of urea and thiourea were treated simultaneously under the same thermal conditions, in situ creating a novel layered g-C3N4/g-C3N4 metal-free heterojunction (g-g CN heterojunction). This synthesis method is facile, economic, and environmentally benign using easily available earth-abundant green precursors. The confirmation of isotype g-g CN heterojunction was based on XRD, HRTEM, valence band XPS, ns-level PL, photocurrent, and EIS measurement. Upon visible-light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons transfer from g-C3N4 (thiourea) to g-C3N4 (urea) driven by the conduction band offset of 0.10 eV, whereas the photogenerated holes transfer from g-C3N4 (urea) to g-C3N4 (thiourea) driven by the valence band offset of 0.40 eV. The potential difference between the two g-C3N4 components in the heterojunction is the main driving force for efficient charge separation and transfer. For the removal of NO in air, the g-g CN heterojunction exhibited significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity over g-C3N4 alone and physical mixture of g-C3N4 samples. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of g-g CN isotype heterojunction can be directly ascribed to efficient charge separation and transfer across the heterojunction interface as well as prolonged lifetime of charge carriers. This work demonstrated that rational design and construction of isotype heterojunction could open up a new avenue for the development of new efficient visible-light photocatalysts.",

Here, the near-field optical enhancement increases the electron-hole pair generation rate at the surface of the TiO2, thus increasing the amount of photogenerated charge contributing to catalysis.

These formed in-plane holes not only endow GCN nanosheets with more exposed active edges and cross-plane diffusion channels that greatly speed up mass and photogenerated charge transfer, but also provide numerous boundaries and thus decrease the aggregation. Compared to BGCN, the resultant HGCN has a much higher specific surface area of 196 m(2) g(-1), together with an enlarged bandgap of 2.95 eV. In addition, the HGCN is demonstrated to be self-modified with carbon vacancies that make HGCN show much broader light absorption extending to the near-infrared region, a higher donor density, and remarkably longer lifetime of charge carriers. As such, HGCN has a much higher photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of nearly 20 times the rate of BGCN.",

The optimized RGO-Zn0.8Cd0.2S photocatalyst has a high H2-production rate of 1824 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) at the RGO content of 0.25 wt % and the apparent quantum efficiency of 23.4% at 420 nm (the energy conversion efficiency is ca. 0.36% at simulated one-sun (AM 1.5G) illumination). The results exhibit significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen production by 450% compared with that of the pristine Zn0.8Cd0.2S, and are better than that of the optimized Pt-Zn0.8Cd0.2S under the same reaction conditions, showing that the RGO-Zn0.8Cd0.2S nanocomposite represents one of the most highly active metal sulfide photocatalyts in the absence of noble metal cocatalysts.

This high photocatalytic H-2-production activity is due to the deposition of TiO2 nanosheets on graphene sheets, which act as an electron acceptor to efficiently separate the photogenerated charge carriers. The observed enhancement in the photocatalytic activity is due to the lower absolute potential of graphene/graphene(-) (-0.08 V vs. SHE, pH 0) in comparison to the conduction band (-0.24 V) of anatase TiO2, meanwhile the aforementioned absolute value is higher than the reduction potential of H+ (0 V), which favors the electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to graphene sheets and the reduction of H+, thus enhancing photocatalytic H-2- production activity.

The selection of the Au nanocrystals is so that their surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) wavelength matches the photonic band gap of the photonic crystal and thus that the SPR of the Au receives remarkable assistance from the photonic crystal substrate. The design of the composite material is expected to significantly increase the Au SPR intensity and consequently boost the hot electron injection from the Au nanocrystals into the conduction band of TiO2, leading to a considerably enhanced water splitting performance of the material under visible light.

Recently, various heterostructured photocatalysts with high efficiency and good stability have been fabricated. Among them, 2D/2D van der Waals (VDW) heterojunctions have received tremendous attention, since this architecture can promote the interfacial charge separation and transfer and provide massive reactive centers. On the other hand, currently, most photocatalysts are composed of metal elements with high cost, limited reserves, and hazardous environmental impact. Hence, the development of metal-free photocatalysts is desirable. Here, a novel 2D/2D VDW heterostructure of metal-free phosphorene/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is fabricated. The phosphorene/g-C3N4 nanocomposite shows an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic H-2 production activity of 571 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) in 18 v% lactic acid aqueous solution. This improved performance arises from the intimate electronic coupling at the 2D/2D interface, corroborated by the advanced characterizations techniques, e.g., synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and theoretical calculations.

Comparing the band edge positions with the redox potentials of water shows that single-layer monochalcogenides are potential photocatalysts for water splitting. Moreover, the bandgaps, band edge positions, and optical absorption of the single-layer monochalcogenides can be tuned by biaxial strain to increase the efficiency of solar energy conversion. Finally, calculations of the enthalpy of solvation of the single-layer monochalcogenides suggest their stability in aqueous solution.",

However, despite very significant experimental effort, a comprehensive theoretical description of the hot carrier generation process is still missing. In this work we develop a theoretical model for the plasmon-induced hot carrier process and apply it to spherical silver nanoparticles and nanoshells. In this model, the conduction electrons of the metal are described as free particles in a finite spherical potential well, and the plasmon-induced hot carrier production is calculated using Fermi's golden rule. We show that the inclusion of many body interactions has only a minor influence on the results. Using the model we calculate the rate of hot carrier generation, finding that it closely follows the spectral profile of the plasmon. Our analysis reveals that particle size and hot carrier lifetime play a central role in determining both the production rate and the energy distribution of the hot carriers. Specifically, larger nanoparticle sizes and shorter lifetimes result in higher carrier production rates but smaller energies, and vice versa. We characterize the efficiency of the hot carrier generation process by introducing a figure of merit that measures the number of high energy carriers generated per plasmon. Furthermore, we analyze the spatial distribution and directionality of these excitations.

Due to the limited electrochemical window of Lix(TaO6/2)2(PO4/2)1 (LTPO), a direct contact with Li metal or high voltage cathode materials leads to degradation, but as demonstrated in this work, semi-solid-state batteries, where LTPO is protected from direct contact with lithium by organic buffer layers, achieve stable cycling.",

      "input": "Each cell of a battery stores electrical energy as chemical energy in two electrodes, a reductant (anode) and an oxidant (cathode), separated by an electrolyte that transfers the ionic component of the chemical reaction inside the cell and forces the electronic component outside the battery. The output on discharge is an external electronic current I at a voltage V for a time Delta t. The chemical reaction of a rechargeable battery must be reversible on the application of a charging I and V. Critical parameters of a rechargeable battery are safety, density of energy that can be stored at a specific power input and retrieved at a specific power output, cycle and shelf life, storage efficiency, and cost of fabrication. Conventional ambient-temperature rechargeable batteries have solid electrodes and a liquid electrolyte. The positive electrode (cathode) consists of a host framework into which the mobile (working) cation is inserted reversibly over a finite solid solution range. The solid solution range, which is reduced at higher current by the rate of transfer of the working ion across electrode/electrolyte interfaces and within a host, limits the amount of charge per electrode formula unit that can be transferred over the time Delta t = Delta t(I). Moreover, the difference between energies of the LUMO and the HOMO of the electrolyte, i.e., electrolyte window, determines the maximum voltage for a long shelf and cycle life. The maximum stable voltage with an aqueous electrolyte is 1.5 V; the Li-ion rechargeable battery uses an organic electrolyte with a larger window, which increase the density of stored energy for a given Delta t. Anode or cathode electrochemical potentials outside the electrolyte window can increase V, but they require formation of a passivating surface layer that must be permeable to Li+ and capable of adapting rapidly to the changing electrode surface area as the electrode changes volume during cycling. A passivating surface layer adds to the impedance of the Li+ transfer across the electrode/electrolyte interface and lowers the cycle life of a battery cell. Moreover, formation of a passivation layer on the anode robs Li from the cathode irreversibly on an initial charge, further lowering the reversible Delta t. These problems plus the cost of quality control of manufacturing plague development of Li-ion rechargeable batteries that can compete with the internal combustion engine for powering electric cars and that can provide the needed low-cost storage of electrical energy generated by renewable wind and/or solar energy. Chemists are contributing to incremental improvements of the conventional strategy by investigating and controlling electrode passivation layers, improving the rate of Li+ transfer across electrode/electrolyte interfaces, identifying electrolytes with larger windows while retaining a Li+ conductivity sigma(Li) > 10(-3) S cm(-1), synthesizing electrode morphologies that reduce the size of the active particles while pinning them on current collectors of large surface area accessible by the electrolyte, lowering the cost of cell fabrication, designing displacement-reaction anodes of higher capacity that allow a safe, fast charge, and designing alternative cathode hosts. However, new strategies are needed for batteries that go beyond powering hand-held devices, such as using electrode hosts with two-electron redox centers; replacing the cathode hosts by materials that undergo displacement reactions (e.g. sulfur) by liquid cathodes that may contain flow-through redox molecules, or by catalysts for air cathodes; and developing a solid electrolyte separator membrane that allows an organic and aqueous liquid electrolyte on the anode and cathode sides, respectively. Opportunities exist for the chemist to bring together oxide and polymer or graphene chemistry in imaginative morphologies.",

However, the uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite produces large morphological variations, resulting in a wide spread of photovoltaic performance in the resulting devices, which hampers the prospects for practical applications. Here we describe a sequential deposition method for the formation of the perovskite pigment within the porous metal oxide film. PbI2 is first introduced from solution into a nanoporous titanium dioxide film and subsequently transformed into the perovskite by exposing it to a solution of CH3NH3I. We find that the conversion occurs within the nanoporous host as soon as the two components come into contact, permitting much better control over the perovskite morphology than is possible with the previously employed route. Using this technique for the fabrication of solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly increases the reproducibility of their performance and allows us to achieve a power conversion efficiency of approximately 15 per cent (measured under standard AM1.5G test conditions on solar zenith angle, solar light intensity and cell temperature).

However, passivating the perovskite surface that interfaces with the electron-transporting layer is difficult, because the surface-treatment agents on the electron-transporting layer may dissolve while coating the perovskite thin film. Alternatively, interfacial defects may not be a concern if a coherent interface could be formed between the electron-transporting and perovskite layers. Here we report the formation of an interlayer between a SnO2 electron-transporting layer and a halide perovskite light-absorbing layer, achieved by coupling Cl-bonded SnO2 with a Cl-containing perovskite precursor. This interlayer has atomically coherent features, which enhance charge extraction and transport from the perovskite layer, and fewer interfacial defects. The existence of such a coherent interlayer allowed us to fabricate perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 25.8 per cent (certified 25.5 per cent)under standard illumination. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices maintained about 90 per cent of their initial efficiency even after continuous light exposure for 500 hours. Our findings provide guidelines for designing defect-minimizing interfaces between metal halide perovskites and electron-transporting layers.",

To address above-mentioned issues, herein, a nano-CaSiO3 layer was coated on the surface of Zn metal anode via the solution casting method. Results showed that this hydrophobic coating layer could effectively inhibit the direct contact of Zn metal anode with electrolyte, suppressing its corrosion and side reactions during Zn deposition/stripping.

The formation mechanism of LiF-rich SEI was investigated using first-principles calculation, revealing that ZIFs-NH2 makes the C-F bond in TFSI- longer compared with ZIFs-CH3, which leads to easier breakage of the C-F bond and promoted the formation of LiF. The simple design idea of using organic catalysis to generate more stable SEI provides a new aspect for preparing high-performance lithium metal batteries.

This article reviews the five different types of IEM selectivity, namely charge, valence, specific ion, ion/solvent, and ion/uncharged solute selectivities. Technological pathways to advance the selectivities through the sorption and migration mechanisms of transport in IEM are critically analyzed. Because of the underlying principles governing transport, efforts to enhance selectivity by tuning the membrane structural and chemical properties are almost always accompanied by a concomitant decline in permeability of the desired ion. Suppressing the undesired crossover of solvent and neutral species is crucial to realize the practical implementation of several technologies, including bioelectrochemical systems, hypersaline electrodialysis desalination, fuel cells, and redox flow batteries, but the ion/solvent and ion/uncharged solute selectivities are relatively understudied, compared to the ion/ion selectivities. Deepening fundamental understanding of the transport phenomena, specifically the factors underpinning structure-property-performance relationships, will be vital to guide the informed development of more selective IEMs. Innovations in material and membrane design offer opportunities to utilize ion discrimination mechanisms that are radically different from conventional IEMs and potentially depart from the putative permeability-selectivity tradeoff. Advancements in IEM selectivity can contribute to meeting the aqueous separation needs of water, energy, and environmental challenges. (C) The Author(s) 2023.",

Risk reduction in many applications requires an understanding of the effects of the charging/discharging rate on the electrode structure during the battery life cycle. Cyclic charging/discharging experiments of wound 18 650 cylindrical LIBs were conducted at different charging/discharging rates (1C and 2C) to determine the effect of rate on electrode deformation. The charging/discharging capacity as well as battery voltage and time were analyzed during cycling. To acquire electrode deformation images and meet the requirements of computed tomography (CT) within 2 min during the charging/discharging process, sparse-view CT was performed at fixed cycle intervals. Subsequently, a sparse-view reconstruction network was proposed to generate a slice image. Finally, the electrode displacement and strain fields were calculated using the augmented Lagrangian digital image correlation algorithm. The causes of electrode deformation were analyzed and discussed from the perspective of molecular and macroscopic structure. Experimental results show that the structural similarity, peak signal-to-noise ratio and root mean square error in the reconstructed image of the axial section within the battery obtained via the proposed network were 0.9616, 38.7411 dB and 0.0108, respectively, which were better than the other methods of comparison. After 100 cycles, the capacity decay of the battery at 2C was 9.23-fold higher than that at 1C. After 100 cycles at 2C, the maximum displacement of the electrode reached 0.46 mm along the x-direction. The electrode structural deformation of the battery can be intuitively understood at different rates, which facilitates reasonable utilization and structural optimization of the battery.",

Although the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) coils are misaligned, the scooters can be freely charged in the charging station by the proposed frequency modulation method without additional power converters in the Tx and Rx sides. In order to implement frequency modulation control, the Rx side can transmit the required information to the Tx side through the magnetic coupling between Tx and Rx coils, i.e., magnetic in-band communication, in the suggested approach. By virtue of the proposed magnetic in-band communication method, the switching frequency can be modulated so that the load power for charging the battery in the Rx side is appropriately controlled, considering the battery charging profile. Contrary to the Qi standard technology using both amplitude shift keying (ASK) and frequency shift keying, the proposed magnetic communication protocol is optimally and simply designed for targeting scooter wireless charging applications. Because the proposed communication method is based on only ASK technique for unidirectional information delivery, the coil misalignment sensitivity and the complexity of the communication process can be reduced, which guarantees the robust frequency modulation control for load power regulation. A 100 W power level prototype for the charging station and the scooters was fabricated and verified by simulations and experiments. The 97.3% of the coil-to-coil efficiency and 90.6% of the dc-to-dc efficiency were obtained at a nominal operating point of k = k(nom) and P-L = 100.8 W.

Parameter estimation assisted by the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model is much more cost-effective than direct measurement methods. However, this is a nontrivial task, because the simulation of the P2D model is time-consuming. Alternatively, surrogate models such as reduced-order/data-driven models are often used to accelerate the parameter estimation process. Each category of surrogate models has its own strengths and weaknesses. Traditionally, reduced-order models run faster than data-driven models, while data-driven models are more accurate than reduced-order models. To leverage the complementary advantages of these two kinds of surrogate models, we make an interesting attempt to combine them compactly, thus proposing a two-phase surrogate model-assisted parameter estimation algorithm (TPSMA-PEAL). In the first phase, a fast reduced-order model is designed for parameter prescreening. In the second phase, a high-fidelity data-driven model is developed for fine estimation. In TPSMA-PEAL, except the time-consuming simulation, the other two challenges (i.e., the overfitting problem and the low observability of some parameters) are also considered from the perspective of optimization. Note that TPSMA-PEAL takes advantage of differential evolution and parameter sensitivity analysis to address them. Simulations and experiments verify that TPSMA-PEAL is efficient and accurate.",

The addition of a strongly absorbing small molecule acceptor into a P3HT-based non- fullerene blend increases the device efficiency up to 7.7 +/- 0.1% without any solvent additives. The improvement is assigned to changes in microstructure that reduce charge recombination and increase the photovoltage, and to improved light harvesting across the visible region. The stability of P3HT- based devices in ambient conditions is also significantly improved relative to polymer: fullerene devices. Combined with a low-bandgap donor polymer ( PBDTTT- EFT, also known as PCE10), the two mixed acceptors also lead to solar cells with 11.0 +/- 0.4% efficiency and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.03 +/- 0.01V.",

Conversion efficiencies in the range of 25.0% have been obtained for all variations studied in this work, which cover 150 mu m to 400 gm thick wafers and resistivities from 1 Omega cm to 10 Omega cm. We present a detailed cell analysis based on three-dimensional full-area device simulations using the solar cell simulation tool Quokka. We show that the experimental variation of the wafer thickness and resistivity at device level in combination with a detailed simulation study allows the identification of recombination induced loss mechanisms. This is possible because different recombination mechanisms can have a very specific influence on the I-V parameters as a function of W and rho(b). In fact, we identified Shockley-Read-Hall recombination in the c-Si bulk as the source of a significant FF reduction in case of high resistivity Si. This shows that cells made of high resistivity Si are very sensitive to even a weak lifetime limitation in the c-Si bulk. Applying low resistivity 1 Omega cm n-type Si in combination with optimized fabrication processes, we achieved confirmed efficiency values of 25.7%, with a V-oc of 725 mV, a FF of 83.3% and a J(sc) of 42.5 mA/cm(2). This represents the highest efficiency reported for both-sides contacted c-Si solar cells.

Intensive research efforts are being devoted to find new perovskites with red-shifted absorption onset, along with good charge transport properties. Recently, a new perovskite based on the formamidinium cation ((NH2)(2)CH+ = FA) has shown potentially superior properties in terms of band gap and charge transport compared to MAPbI(3). The results have been interpreted in terms of the cation size, with the larger FA cation expectedly delivering reduced band-gaps in Pb-based perovskites.

Our results evidence that the tetragonal-to-quasi cubic structural evolution observed when moving from MA to FA is due to the interplay of size effects and enhanced hydrogen bonding between the FA cations and the inorganic matrix altering the covalent/ionic character of Pb-I bonds. Most notably, the observed cation-induced structural variability promotes markedly different electronic and optical properties in the MAPbI(3) and FAPbI(3) perovskites, mediated by the different spin-orbit coupling, leading to improved charge transport and red-shifted absorption in FAPbI(3) and in general in pseudocubic structures.

As a result, the low polarization (24 mV at 0.25 mA cm(-2)), high Coulombic efficiency (99.36% at 20 mA cm(-2)), and long cycle life (over 3800 h at 0.25 mA cm(-2)) can be obtained for the ZrO2-coated Zn anode. It is believed that the ZrO2 coating layer can also act as an inert physical barrier to decrease the contact of the anode and electrolyte, thus reducing both the Zn corrosion and formation of ZnO densification, and then improve the reversibility of Zn anode. The results demonstrated in this work provide an appealing strategy for the future development of rechargeable Zn-based batteries.",

Zn anode still suffers, however, from low Coulombic efficiency due to the side reactions and dendrite growth in slightly acidic electrolytes. Here, the Zn plating/stripping mechanism is thoroughly investigated in 1 m ZnSO4 electrolyte, demonstrating that the poor performance of Zn metal in mild electrolyte should be ascribed to the formation of a porous by-product (Zn4SO4(OH)(6)center dot xH(2)O) layer and serious dendrite growth. To suppress the side reactions and dendrite growth, a highly viscoelastic polyvinyl butyral film, functioning as an artificial solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI), is homogeneously deposited on the Zn surface via a simple spin-coating strategy. This dense artificial SEI film not only effectively blocks water from the Zn surface but also guides the uniform stripping/plating of Zn ions underneath the film due to its good adhesion, hydrophilicity, ionic conductivity, and mechanical strength. Consequently, this side-reaction-free and dendrite-free Zn electrode exhibits high cycling stability and enhanced Coulombic efficiency, which also contributes to enhancement of the full-cell performance when it is coupled with MnO2 and LiFePO4 cathodes.",

However, a complete mechanistic understanding of electrode overpotential variations that occur during extended cycling of Li metal is lacking. Herein, we demonstrate that when using a Li metal electrode, the dynamic changes in voltage during extended cycles can be increasingly attributed to mass transport. It is shown that these mass transport effects arise as a result of dead Li accumulation at the Li metal electrode, which introduces a tortuous pathway for Li-ion transport. In Li-Li symmetric cells, mass transport effects cause the shape of the galvanostatic voltage response to change from \"peaking\" to \"arcing\", along with an increase in total electrode overpotential. The continued accumulation of dead Li is also conclusively shown to directly cause capacity fade and rapid \"failure\" of Li-LCO full cells containing Li metal anodes.

The linear aging stage is found to be dominated by SEI growth, while the transition from linear to nonlinear aging is attributed to the sharp rise of lithium plating rate. Lithium plating starts to occur in a narrow portion of the anode near the separator after a certain number of cycles. The onset of lithium plating is attributed to the drop of anode porosity associated with SEI growth, which aggravates the local electrolyte potential gradient in the anode. The presence of lithium metal accelerates the porosity reduction, further promoting lithium Plating. This positive feedback leads to exponential increase of lithium plating rate in the late stage of cycling, as well as local pore clogging near the anode/separator interface which in turn leads to a sharp resistance rise.
