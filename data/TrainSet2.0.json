The majority of the current CDots to date exhibit excitation-wavelength-dependent emissions with their maximum emission limited at the blue-light region. Here, a synthesis of multiple-color-emission CDots by controlled graphitization and surface function is reported. The CDots are synthesized through controlled thermal pyrolysis of citric acid and urea. By regulating the thermal-pyrolysis temperature and ratio of reactants, the maximum emission of the resulting CDots gradually shifts from blue to red light, covering the entire light spectrum. Specifically, the emission position of the CDots can be tuned from 430 to 630 nm through controlling the extent of graphitization and the amount of surface functional groups, COOH. The relative photoluminescence quantum yields of the CDots with blue, green, and red emission reach up to 52.6%, 35.1%, and 12.9%, respectively. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the CDots can be uniformly dispersed into epoxy resins and be fabricated as transparent CDots/epoxy composites for multiple-color- and white-light-emitting devices.

Recently, various heterostructured photocatalysts with high efficiency and good stability have been fabricated. Among them, 2D/2D van der Waals (VDW) heterojunctions have received tremendous attention, since this architecture can promote the interfacial charge separation and transfer and provide massive reactive centers. On the other hand, currently, most photocatalysts are composed of metal elements with high cost, limited reserves, and hazardous environmental impact. Hence, the development of metal-free photocatalysts is desirable. Here, a novel 2D/2D VDW heterostructure of metal-free phosphorene/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is fabricated. The phosphorene/g-C3N4 nanocomposite shows an enhanced visible-light photocatalytic H-2 production activity of 571 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) in 18 v% lactic acid aqueous solution. This improved performance arises from the intimate electronic coupling at the 2D/2D interface, corroborated by the advanced characterizations techniques, e.g., synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and theoretical calculations.

The porous network and sulfur nanocrystals enable rapid Ion transport and short Li+ diffusion distance, the Interconnected fibrous graphene provides highly conductive electron transport pathways, and the oxygen-containing (mainly hydroxyl/epoxide) groups show strong binding with polysulfides, preventing their dissolution into the electrolyte based on first-principles calculations. As a result, the G S hybrids show a high capacity, an excellent high-rate performance, and a long life over 100 cycles. These results demonstrate the great potential of this unique hybrid structure as cathodes for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries.",

For over a half-century, the default electrocatalyst for DMFCs has been platinum (Pt). The barriers to widespread deployment of DMFCs, however, are largely linked to the cost of this precious metal and its propensity to become poisoned in its role as the anode catalyst for the oxidation of methanol. Bimetallic platinumgold (PtAu) catalysts, however, offer superior activity for the oxidation of methanol and can operate with increased electrocatalytic stability and resistance to poisoning. Here, we demonstrate a block copolymer template strategy for the preparation of arrays of clusters of PtAu nanocatalysts with tailored composition, particle density, and electrochemical activity. A detailed characterization by XPS, TEM, EDX, and electrochemistry was used to assign a coreshell nanostructure to the 3 nm PtAu nanocatalysts that constitute the clusters. The activity Pt-rich coreshell PtAu nanocatalysts for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol was approximately 24-fold that of a current Pt benchmark catalyst (ETEK), only 28% less than that of the PtRu bimetallic benchmark catalyst (XC-72R), and, in comparison to these same catalysts, exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in its metric for tolerance to carbonaceous poisoning (I-f/I-b ratio).",

In order to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs, photocurrent density to photovoltage (J-V) characteristic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out. The DSSC fabricated using combustion synthesized and commercial TiO2 exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 6.11% and 6.62%, respectively.

Waste plastics were upcycled into high-quality 3D GNs by using two-step pyrolysis processes, where, a nickel (99.99%) metal mesh was taken as the catalytic and degradation template to get an acid free route for the synthesis of 3D GNs. Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM analysis and XRD analysis show the presence of 1-2 graphene layers within the 3D GNs. Further, the optical band gap study has also been performed to analyze the applicability of 3D GNs for PSCs. The optimized device with 3D GNs shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.40%, whereas the carbon-based control device shows a PCE of 11.04%. Further, all other device parameters such as short circuit current (J(sc)), open circuit voltage (V-oc) and fill factor (FF) have been improved with the addition of 3D GNs. The performance enhancement in 3D GN doped HTM free PSC solar cells is attributed to the enhancement in conductivity and reduced recombination within the device. Further, the photocurrent study shows that the 3D GN device shows better performance as compared to the reference device due to the larger diffusion current.

By introducing a very small amount (0.08%) of volatile NH4Ac through a simple one-step spin coating method, high-quality perovskite layer with lower defect density, larger grain size and pure perovskite composition without alien atom was obtained, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.9%, which is similar to 25% enhancement compared to that of the device without additive. Moreover, stability was also investigated, 6% degradation appeared in PCE of NH4Ac sample after being stored for 1900h in dark. The promoted interface contact of carbon/perovskite results in higher efficiency and longer stability of NH4Ac added perovskite solar cell (PSC). On the other hand, addition of non-volatile ZnAc2 only lead to a slight enhancement of the efficiency. The factors affecting the properties will be discussed in detail. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

These FeS2 nanocrystals were used as a counter electrode (CE) alternative to the conventional Pt CE in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) owing to its tremendous optical properties and low-cost. The obtained FeS2 nanocrystalline materials with excellent shape and phase purity were confirmed through XRD and Raman spectroscopy data. From Tafel, and impedance spectroscopy studies, the catalytic activity FeS2 CEs are found to be comparable with that of Pt CE. Along with the I-3(-)/I- electrolyte, photo-conversion efficiency is found to be 6.9% (spherical), 6.2% (cubic) for the FeS2 CE, and 7% for Pt CE. The excellent performance of the FeS2 CE in DSSCs makes it a distinctive choice among the various CE materials studied including low-cost photovoltaics.",

Herein, TiO(2)nanorods (TiO(2)NRs) are grown onTiO(2)seed layers coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by using a hydrothermal method and then are utilized as the electronic transport layer in PSCs. The main concern, after hydrothermal growth of TiO(2)NRs, is that their crystallinity can be improved by a sequential high-temperature treatment at 450 degrees C. In addition to high-temperature annealing, a low-temperature treatment with boiling water, which is expected to clean the surface of the TiO(2)NRs, is developed. In this contribution, the champion PSCs are those based on TiO(2)NRs where boiling water treatment achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.50%, whereas a PCE of 12.91% is obtained from PSCs based on TiO(2)NRs with high-temperature annealing. The remarkable ease of using a water-assisted process offers an efficient approach to the removal of residuals adsorbed on the surface and circumvents the disadvantage of a thermal annealing method resulting in high-production costs. This low-temperature treatment can be used to improve TiO(2)films in flexible PSCs.",

Herein, we report a convenient approach for the synthesis of Cu nanoparticle@carbon nanorod (Cu@CNR) composites by the direct pyrolysis of HKUST-1 precursors at temperatures above 1000 degrees C. The Cu@CNR composite whose carbon nanorods (CNRs) are encased with Cu nanoparticles (Cu NPs) exhibits superior catalytic activity towards polysulfide reduction in QDSCs, which might be ascribed to the abundant CuxS active sites derived from Cu NPs and the excellent charge transfer capability of graphitized CNRs. Benefiting from the encasement in CNRs, the dissociation of CuxS from counter electrodes (CEs) is effectively suppressed. When Cu@CNR composites deposited on F-doped tin oxide glass were used as CEs, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.50% (J(sc) = 26.50 mA cm(-2), V-oc = 0.628 V, and FF = 0.573) under one sun illumination was observed with Zn-Cu-In-Se QD sensitizers and polysulfide electrolyte.",

However, SNPC gives low yield and is expensive. Herein, we report a new and efficient method for synthesizing a S, N-co-doped mesoporous carbon material through the carbonization of S, N-containing precursors in molten ZnCl2, where ZnCl2 served as the ionic solvent and Lewis acid catalyst. The resultant SNPC-800 showed a mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 1235 m(2) g(-1) and a mesopore-size range of 10-45 nm, which were considerably larger than those obtained through the carbonization of ionic liquids and fabrication of graphene oxides. Furthermore, ORR measurements indicated good catalytic activity, comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Also the SNPC-800 material exhibited excellent catalytic stability, and high methanol tolerance compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculation results revealed that the catalytic properties originated from the synergistic effect of the S/N dopant and that the main catalytic reaction path followed an associative mechanism. LIB tests further showed high reversible capacity, as well as excellent cycling stability and rate performance.",
